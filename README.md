# Bye

Bye uninstalls programs.

It requires Windows and the .NET framework. 

Add `bye.exe` to your path, and then use like so:
`bye someannoyingprogram`

If `bye` is not sure what program to uninstall, it will prompt you:

````
C:\Windows\system32>bye micro
Which?
[0] Blender
[1] Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable`
[...snip...]
````

Type the number and hit enter to proceed.
